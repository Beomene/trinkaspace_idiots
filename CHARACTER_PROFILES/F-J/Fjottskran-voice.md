## Cultural Context
Fjottskran emerged from demons living too close to human settlements, picking up fragments of English from overheard conversations. The result is a linguistic mess that embarrasses even other demons.

The language gets progressively worse under stress - a cruel irony that makes these demons even more pathetic when they most need to communicate clearly.

**Note**: The "sudden English" injections marked with *italics* represent the demon's inability to find adequate Norwegian curse words for their frustration level. ðŸ˜¤ðŸ’¢
