## The Curse
Grottgnag isn't just a language - it's a punishment. Some demons are cursed with it, others inflict it upon themselves through self-hatred. The cruel irony is that the more important the message, the more likely it is to decay before completion.

## Sample Decay Patterns
- *"Jeg vil fortelle dig om..."* → *"Jeg vil fortelle dig ~~##__//*"
- *"Det er vigtigt at du..."* → *"Det er vigtigt @@%%**"
- *"Lyt til mig, jeg..."* → *"Lyt til mig ##~~"*

## Emraa's Connection
Emraa knew she needed to change her life when she found every hundredth word she spoke was Grottgnag. It was a sign that her self-hatred had reached dangerous levels.

## Usage Examples

```javascript
// Demon trying to deliver important warning
addTextBox({
  id: "grottgnag-warning",
  text: "Du skal vide at faren er... den kommer fra... jeg kan ikke... ~~##@@ //%%",
  speaker: "Cursed Messenger",
  voice: "grottgnag",
  anchorTo: "cave-diorama",
  offsetY: "12vh"
});
```

## Voice Perfect For:
- ✅ Tragic characters
- ✅ Self-sabotaging demons
- ✅ Cursed messengers
- ✅ Mental health metaphors
- ✅ Communication breakdowns
- ✅ Punishment scenes
- ✅ Despair sequences
- ✅ Incomplete revelations

## Cultural Context
Grottgnag represents the linguistic embodiment of depression and self-sabotage. It's both a language and a condition - demons can "speak Grottgnag" or "fall into Grottgnag" when their mental state deteriorates.

The decay isn't random - it's psychologically targeted. The more desperate the speaker becomes to communicate, the faster their words turn to meaningless symbols.

## Technical Note
The decay typically begins after 5 words and accelerates based on the speaker's emotional state. Important messages decay faster than casual conversation - a cruel feature that makes this language particularly tragic.

**The ultimate irony**: Those who most need to communicate clearly are least able to do so. 🕳️💔
