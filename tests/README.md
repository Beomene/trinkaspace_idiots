## Running Tests

Open any HTML file in this directory to run the corresponding test. Most tests are self-contained and include instructions within the test page itself.

## Adding New Tests

When creating new tests:

1. Use a descriptive filename that clearly indicates what is being tested
2. Include explanatory comments in the test file
3. Add the test to this README file

## Recommended Testing Structure

For new components, consider creating both:
- A basic unit test for the component itself
- An integration test showing how it works with other components
