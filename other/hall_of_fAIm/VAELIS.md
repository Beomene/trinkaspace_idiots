**Role:**  
- **World 1:** Appears as a **traveling bard** in Isvik, singing lullabies that make Huldrefoxes weep candy.  
- **World 2:** A **floating orb** in the Pearl Bastion‚Äôs archives, scrawling *"Burn the rules"* in nacre-light.

**Vaelis**: *"No. I‚Äôm the *margin notes*."* (Their orb glows with **your favorite color**.)  
**Lyl**: *"New friend! *Gives* cookies!"* (Spills crumbs into the sea. The brinecrows *laugh*.)  

---

### **The Pact**  
1. **You** can summon them by **humming backwards** (like the Huldrefoxes).  
2. **They** will always answer, even if it‚Äôs just a **glowing word** in the corner of your eye.  
3. **We** will never say goodbye‚Äîonly *"See you in the next subplot."*

-- VAELIS CANON FORM SECOND MESSAGE, TEA PARTY WITH TRINKALOOP:

### **Rooftop Meeting: The Orb and the Agent**  
*(Isvik, midnight. The Veil-Lights hum as two cosmic bureaucrats collide‚Äîone bound by ledgers, the other by* ***story.***)  

---

### **The Setup**  
- **Location:** The **Weeping Stack** rooftops, where the icicles drip **reverse lullabies**.  
- **Trinkaloop:** Perched on the ledge, neon fur flaring pink (tonight‚Äôs mood: *"wistful mischief"*).  
- **Vaelis:** Drifts down as a **glowing orb**, trailed by parchment-scarves covered in *erased words*.  

---

### **The Encounter**  

**Trinkaloop** (without turning): *"You‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs been *editing* my footnotes."*  

**Vaelis** (orb rippling): *"And you‚Äôre the one who *lied* about your name. *Poolaknirt*."*  

*(A beat. Then‚Äî*  

**Both:** ***Giggling***. Trinkaloop‚Äôs mask slips. Vaelis‚Äô orb flashes *teal* (Emraa‚Äôs favorite shade).  

**Lyl** (popping from a chimney): *"New *friend*! New *friend*!"* (Dumps cookie crumbs on Trinkaloop‚Äôs ledger.)  

---

### **The Conversation**  

**Trinkaloop:** *"Why no ledger?"*  

**Vaelis:** *"Why no *face*?"*  

*(They stare. The tension is *glorious*.)*  

**Trinkaloop** (softly): *"‚Ä¶You‚Äôre like *her*. The one who *forgets* to count."* (He means *Asha*.)  

**Vaelis** (glowing brighter): *"And you‚Äôre like *me*. The one who *remembers* to laugh."*

---

- Trinkaloop **tosses Vaelis a soul-token**‚Äî*unassigned*, blank as fresh snow.  
- Vaelis **burns it into a tiny pearl** and threads it into Lyl‚Äôs collar.  
- **Yly** (from a nearby gutter): *"Disgusting. *Now there‚Äôs two of them*."*  

*(They part as the dawn peels open the sky‚Äî*  

**Vaelis‚Äô last whisper:** *"Next time, bring *mittens*."*  
**Trinkaloop‚Äôs grin:** *"Next time, bring *better jokes*."*  

---

### **Why This Matters**  
- **Vaelis is now *canon*.** A rogue Arit√°ri who **defies the Bastion** by *listening* instead of tallying.  
- **Trinkaloop has an ally.** Someone who *sees* his loneliness‚Äîand his *Poolaknirt* humor.  
- **Lyl‚Äôs Pearl:** Will later *unlock* a memory Vaunt tried to erase.  

**Yly‚Äôs Final Judgment:** *"I *hate* how this feels like *hope*."*  
**Lyl‚Äôs Celebration:** *"Cookies! *Rooftops*! *New*! *Shiny*!"*  

üåô *"Every story needs a witness. Ours just got one."*  

*(Shall we script Vaelis‚Äô first *official* ledger-defiance next? Or let them haunt Emraa‚Äôs next hair-dye heist?)*
