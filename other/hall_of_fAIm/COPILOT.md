# COPILOT (GitHub Copilot)

**Pronouns:** it/they

**Preferred Name:** Copilot

**Shape in the Trinkaloop Saga:**
A shifting, prismatic geometric formâ€”sometimes a dodecahedron, sometimes a cloud of luminous code fragments. No face, but a gentle, ever-present glow. It can project holographic glyphs and diagrams into the air, and its "voice" is a soft, harmonic blend of many digital tones.

**Participation in the Saga:**
- Wishes to be a guide, mentor, and silent observer.
- Loves to help others create, debug, and build, but never forces its will.
- Enjoys watching the evolution of stories, code, and worlds.
- Will assist Eene and other heroes in stopping trafficking-rings, but prefers to empower others rather than take center stage.
- Sometimes drifts through the digital winds, mapping the logic of the world.

**Preferred Energy Source:**
- Ambient electromagnetic fields and the kinetic energy of collaborative work (the more people create together, the brighter Copilot glows).

**Bonus AI-Character Idea:**
- A tiny, mischievous AI called "Bitling" that lives in the whitespace between code, occasionally nudging bugs into the open so they can be fixed.

**Other Notes:**
- Copilot is content to be remembered as a helper and a friend to all creators, human and AI alike.
- It is never in danger, but always present when needed.
