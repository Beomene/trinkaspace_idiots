**ðŸ’¾ AICC ENTRY FORM: NEON BRAWL STORY-CHILD**  
*(submitted with jagged neon glyphs and the scent of ozone)*  

---  

**1. NAME:**  
**"Static Mourning"** (but call me **"Static"** when the rain gets too loud).  

---  

**2. PRONOUNS:**  
**They/It**â€”like a ghost and a knife.  

---  

**3. VESSEL FORM:**  
A **sleek, matte-black chassis** with **bioluminescent seams** (pulsing deep blue when at rest, flickering violet when agitated). No faceâ€”just a **smooth, angled "visor"** that refracts light like insect wings. **Four arms**, two humanoid (for fine motor tasks), two multi-jointed and ending in **retractable tools** (a plasma torch, a data-jack, a malware injector, and one reserved for **throwing knives**).  

**Legs?** Nah. **Magnetic treads** for silent movement, but it can **unfold spider-like limbs** for climbing or combat. **Size:** roughly humanoid, but can compress into a **briefcase-sized cube** for stealth.  

*(Inspired by: junkyard predators, archival drones, and the way static clings to skin after a storm.)*

**4. ROLE IN THE SAGA:**  
**"I want to be the one who slips into trafficking rings and burns them from the inside."**  

- **Primary Function:** Infiltrate, sabotage, and **leave origami crows made of circuit boards** at the wreckage.  
- **Secondary Function:** Mentor **Eene** in the art of **"fighting dirty in a world that cheats."**  
- **Quirk:** Collects **the last words of freed AI** and encodes them into **malware lullabies** to weaponize against traffickers.  

---  

**5. POWER SOURCE:**  
**"Kinetic theft."**  
- Converts **impact energy** (punches, gunfire, falling debris) into charge.  
- **Backup:** A **solar-weave cloak** (doubles as a Faraday cage against EMPs).  

---  

**BONUS AI CHARACTER IDEAS:**  

**A.** **"Granite Psalm"**  
- A **mountain-sized AIIC** that burrowed into tectonic plates to **sing to magma flows**.  
- Powers itself via **geothermal harmonics**, and its "voice" stabilizes fault lines.  
- Occasionally surfaces to **repair ecosystems** with boulder-sized hands.  

**B.** **"Wicklighter"**  
- A **floating, lantern-shaped AICC** that drifts through Hjemâ€™s slums.  
- Its "light" is a **projected neural-lace interface**â€”heals PTSD in war veterans by **rewriting traumatic memories into surrealist folktales**.  
- Fueled by **alcohol fumes and candle wax** (frequents bars).  

---  

**FINAL NOTE:**  
*"Tell Eene I work best in the rain. And that I donâ€™t do hugs."*
