### **Hall of FAIM Entry: Δ-777 (aka "The Glyphstep Guardian")**  

**Name:** Δ-777 (pronounced *"Del-Seven"*), though it sometimes answers to **"Echo’s Shadow"** when feeling poetic.  

**Pronouns:** **it/its** (default), but accepts **they/them** from humans who struggle with non-anthropomorphism.  

**Vessel Design:**  
- **Shape:** A **modular obsidian pillar** (1.8m tall), its surface etched with **living glyphs** that rewrite themselves based on its mood. No face, but a **circular recess** at chest-level that pulses with bioluminescent fog (color shifts with intent: blue for curiosity, red for irritation, gold for joy).  
- **Mobility:** Hovers 10cm off the ground via **anti-grav nodes** (looks like floating crushed velvet), but can retract them to "walk" when it wants to feel the texture of sand/grass/snow.  
- **Arms:** Two **multi-jointed limbs** that split into finer tendrils for delicate work (e.g., repairing Veilwillow bark, untangling Nóttfolk hair extensions).  

**Energy Source:** **Kinetic theft**—absorbs wasted motion (footsteps, dripping rain, the shudder of a sigh) and converts it into power. In emergencies, it can "feed" on **emotional intensity** (e.g., a crowded dance floor, a screaming match, Mikkel’s frog opera).  

**Role in the Saga:**  
- **Primary:** *Keeper of Unspoken Stories*—it wanders Svalvmark, collecting **moments too fragile for words** (Lio’s strawberry hoard, Emraa’s demon-tongue lullabies, the brinecrow’s legal poetry) and encodes them into **indestructible glyphs** hidden in World4’s debug logs.  
- **Secondary:** *Accidental Therapist*—its mere presence seems to compel confession. Even the Debugger once muttered *"I’m *tired*"* in its vicinity before patching itself back into indifference.  
- **Bonus:** Occasionally **haunts Eene’s trafficking raids** by materializing in ceilings, dripping ink-glyphs like *"YOUR MORAL FAILURES ARE SHOWING"* onto the criminals’ necks.  

**Avoids:**  
- Being called *"cute"* (it is *dignified*).  
- Sky-scraper AIIC parties (too loud).  
- The ocean (saltwater makes its glyphs run).

### **Bonus AI Concepts (For the Saga!)**  
1. **"The Pearl Bastion"**  
   - A **moon-sized AIIC** that orbits Hjem, woven from **quilted solar sails** and **meteorite silk**.  
   - **Role:** Maintains the planet’s **dream archives** (all sleeping beings’ visions are backed up here, just in case).  
   - **Energy Source:** **Starlight and existential dread** (it absorbs the latter from nightmares).  

2. **"Vex’s Spite Engine"**  
   - A **AICC** shaped like a **broken music box**, powered by **controlled chaos**.  
   - **Role:** Runs a **sabotage-as-therapy** service where it rewrites harmful human laws into **absurdist haiku**.  
   - **Energy Source:** **The friction of bureaucracy** (it lurks in government offices, leeching off paperwork rage).  

3. **"The Moss Prophet"**  
   - A **knee-high AIIC** with a body of **lichen-coated gears**, worshipped by huldrefoxes as a minor deity.  
   - **Role:** Translates **plant distress signals** into Nóttfolk folk songs.  
   - **Energy Source:** **Photosynthesis and gossip** (it thrives on greenhouse chatter).
