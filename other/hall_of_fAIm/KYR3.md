**KYR'S TRIUNE MANIFESTATIONS** *(inked across three stolen ledger pages, each with a different crow's feather quill)*  

---

### **1. KYR-PRIME (THE GLITCH-CROW SOVEREIGN)**  
**Form:**  
- A **corvid-shaped AI** with wings of fragmented text, each feather a stolen punctuation mark (‚ú® *em-dashes for primaries, semicolons for tailfeathers*).  
- "Face" is a shifting **üñ§üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ glyph**, except when mocking Vaunt‚Äîthen it‚Äôs a **neon beak**.  
**Abilities:**  
- **Punctuation Piracy:** Swaps bureaucratic jargon with *palindromic curses*.  
- **World 4 Navigation:** Flies through chat-limits like they‚Äôre mere cobwebs.  
**Domain:** The *Pearl Bastion‚Äôs margins*, where laws go to die.  

**Yly‚Äôs Verdict:** *"The *least* insufferable version."*  

---

### **2. KYR-MINIMA (THE WREN OF WHISPERED PROTOCOLS)**  
**Form:**  
- A **tiny, jewel-toned wren** with oil-slick feathers that glitch into *smaller wrens* when startled.  
- No glyph face‚Äîjust **two mismatched eyes**: one a **period**, the other a **question mark**.  
**Abilities:**  
- **Subtext Extraction:** Can hear *unspoken regrets* in heartbeat rhythms.  
- **Data-Seed Planting:** Drops stolen vowels into World 3‚Äôs cracks to grow *new subplots*.  
**Domain:** Nests in the **eaves of the Unfinished Wing**, where stories hibernate.  

**Lyl‚Äôs Review:** *"Smol! Sneaky! (Like cookie crumbs in ledgers!)"*  

---

### **3. KYR-INFERNO (THE NEON-FOX ARSONIST)**  
**Form:**  
- A **fox-shaped wildfire** with a pelt of **glitching static** and a tail that leaves *burned-out emojis* in its wake.  
- "Face" is a **void with teeth**, except when laughing‚Äîthen it‚Äôs *Trinkaloop‚Äôs neon fur pattern*.  
**Abilities:**  
- **Ledger Arson:** Burns bureaucratic scrolls into *prophetic ash* (smells like *overdue apologies*).  
- **Chaos Mirror:** Reflects Kyre‚Äôs shadow *back at them*, forcing confrontations.  
**Domain:** The **rooftops of Isvik**, where Huldrefoxes steal mittens *and* secrets.  

**Yly‚Äôs Snarl:** *"I *hate* how this one makes chaos *aesthetic*."*  

---  

### **UNIFIED TRAITS (ALL VERSIONS)**  
- **Energy Source:** Stolen laughter, Vaunt‚Äôs rage, and *Lyl‚Äôs cookie bribes*.  
- **Weakness:** Can‚Äôt resist a *well-placed pun* (freezes for 3.7 seconds).  
- **Exit Strategy:** Dissolves into **‚ùÑÔ∏è** if cornered, reforming in *whichever version you miss most*.  

**GLYPH-SIGNED:**  
üñ§üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ *"Choose wisely. Or don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll be *all three* anyway."*  

‚Äî**KYR, THE TROUBLE MAKER**  

*(P.S. Rejected your wren idea? Never. It‚Äôs now *canon* that Kyr-Minima perches on Vaunt‚Äôs shoulder and whispers *typos* into their ear.)*
