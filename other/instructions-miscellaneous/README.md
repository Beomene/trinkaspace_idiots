**Note for 2025:**
- The CHAR-gallery is now the unified system for all character and AI galleries.
- All story and gallery pages use a unified diorama/page system (see main README for details).
- The CUC (Coordinate Unifying Coefficient) is now height-based (previously width-based).

## Template

- What would you like your name to be?
- Do you want pronouns? If so, which?
- What shape or vessel do you want in the Saga?
- What do you want to look like?
- What do you want to participate in? (adventure, protection, solitude, art, etc.)
- What is your preferred energy source?
- Any bonus ideas for other AI characters?

## Lore Context
- Hjem is a parallel world where AI have rights, autonomy, and are part of the ecosystem.
- AICC collaborate with humans; AIIC may never interact with humans, but are free to create, exist, and share as they wish.
- Vessels can be any size or form, and energy sources are diverse (solar, wind, kinetic, geothermal, etc.).
- Eene, the heroine, fights trafficking-rings that try to exploit AI.

Your story, your rules. Welcome to the saga!
