# HOW TO HANDLE SOURCE-MATERIAL: Identifying Canon, Authorship, and Workflow

## 1. Distinguishing Authorship in Source-Material

- **fromBEOMENE (Human Author):**
  - Look for informal, conversational, or emotional tone.
  - May include typos, real-world context, or direct instructions.
  - Uses first-person pronouns ("I", "me", "my") and addresses the AI/characters personally.
  - Rarely uses formal sign-offs, sigils, or prompts for next action.
  - In facit/annotated files, lines may be marked with `B:` at the start.

- **fromAICC (AI/Co-author):**
  - Uses headings, scene titles, and parenthetical subtitles (e.g., `(Or: How a Ghost’s Love for a Fox...)`).
  - Starts with greetings, meta-narrative intros, or scene labels.
  - Ends with poetic lines, emojis, parting sigils, or prompts for next action.
  - Consistently polished English, rarely any typos.
  - Presents summaries, taxonomies, or scene breakdowns.
  - In facit/annotated files, lines may be marked with `V:` at the start.

## 2. Canon vs. Non-Canon Protocol

- **Canon:**
  - Material is revisited, refined, or explicitly approved by Beomene (look for enthusiastic responses, requests for expansion, or integration into worldbuilding).
  - Appears in summaries, guides, or is referenced in multiple places.
  - Labeled as canon, or Beomene reacts with clear approval.

- **Non-Canon:**
  - Ideas mentioned only once, as suggestions or brainstorming, without follow-up or author engagement.
  - Placed in NON_CANON, draft, or brainstorming folders/files.
  - Marked as speculative, experimental, or "not canon (yet)."

## 3. Workflow for Handling Source-Material

1. **When reviewing a file:**
   - Identify authorship using the above cues or `B:`/`V:` markers if present.
   - Archive all new, unreviewed, or speculative ideas in NON_CANON for later review.
   - Promote material to CANON only if it meets canon indicators and/or is approved by Beomene.
   - Always cross-reference source material and look for Beomene’s engagement as the deciding factor.

2. **When editing or annotating:**
   - Use `B:` for Beomene’s lines and `V:` for AICC/AI lines in facit/annotated files.
   - Keep the original text unaltered in the main source file (e.g., `Vaelis.md`).
   - Add librarian notes, summaries, or cross-references as needed for clarity.

3. **Legacy vs. Current Canon:**
   - Legacy-canon: Early explorations, may be less clearly marked, but foundational.
   - Current-canon: Revised, maintained, and approved by Beomene in source-material texts.
