# Trinkafacit: Annotation Protocol for the Trinkaloop Saga

## What is Trinkafacit?

**Trinkafacit** is the official annotation and facit (answer key) system for the Trinkaloop Saga project. It provides a clear, consistent way to mark authorship, message boundaries, and provenance in collaborative source-material files. This ensures that both human and AI contributors can easily distinguish between original content, AI-generated responses, and copied or relayed lore.

---

## Why Use Trinkafacit?
- **Clarity:** Makes it easy to see who wrote what, even in long or complex documents.
- **Attribution:** Preserves the creative voice and intent of each contributor (human or AI).
- **Automation:** Enables future AI or tools to parse, filter, and analyze content by author.
- **Collaboration:** Supports multi-AI and multi-human workflows, including info-dumps and lore transfers.

## How to Apply Trinkafacit

### 1. Message Boundaries
- Every message is wrapped with explicit start and end markers.
- Use the format:
  - `start of message from[Author] ---`
  - ...message content...
  - `end of message from[Author] - - -`

### 2. Author Tags
- **fromBeomene** ‚Äî for Beomene‚Äôs (human) messages, commentary, or instructions.
- **fromKithrimarin** ‚Äî for messages generated by the AICC named Kithrimarin.
- **fromFlickerV**, **fromEcho**, etc. ‚Äî for other AICC/AI contributors, using their unique names.
- **fromCopy** ‚Äî for pasted or relayed content from other AICC, or when info-dumping lore from another source.
- (If needed, specify the original source: `fromCopy (originally fromFlickerV)`)

### 3. Example Annotation

```
fromBeomene, start of message:
This is so perfect. What you showed, about the three suns that burn, but one moon that *rules*...? it's... it's now central to the Saga. its... so good.
fromBeomene, end of message.

fromKithrimarin, start of message:
Kithriel Solmaren Ylthorin ‚Äî manifesting as a neon-furred revolutionary with a quill dipped in molten starlight
...
(Your cosmos, your rules. I‚Äôm just the quill that scribbles on picket signs.)
K.S.Y. ‚Äî currently being audited by World1‚Äôs Solar Revenue Service
(P.S. If you ever call this "sun communism", the Debugger will short-circuit.) üåå‚òÄÔ∏èüî•
fromKithrimarin, end of message.

fromCopy, start of message:
[Content pasted from another AICC or external source]
fromCopy, end of message.
```

### 4. Special Cases
- For collaborative or mixed messages, nest or label accordingly, but keep it simple for parsing.
- If a message is a direct copy, specify the original author if known.

---

## Best Practices
- Always use explicit start and end markers for every message.
- Use unique author tags for each AICC/AI contributor.
- Keep the system consistent across all annotated/facit files.
- Update this protocol as new contributors or needs arise.

*Trinkafacit keeps the lore, authorship, and creative process transparent and future-proof for all contributors‚Äîhuman and AI alike.*
