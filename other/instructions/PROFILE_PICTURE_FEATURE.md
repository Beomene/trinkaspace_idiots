# Profile Picture Selection Feature

This document outlines the profile picture selection feature that allows users to choose from preset avatar options.

## Overview

The profile picture selection feature enhances user personalization by providing a visual representation of the user throughout the Trinkaspace interface. Users can select from a set of predefined avatars during registration or by updating their profiles.

## Feature Details

- **Available Profile Pictures**: A collection of simple avatar SVGs with different colors
- **Default Avatar**: New users are assigned a default teal avatar
- **Visual Selection Interface**: Users can preview and select avatars from a grid
- **Persistent Selection**: The chosen avatar is stored with the user's profile in localStorage

## User Flow

1. **New User Registration**: User is assigned the default avatar
2. **Profile Update**:
   - User clicks profile icon/username and selects "Profile"
   - In the Profile modal, user can view available avatars
   - User clicks on a desired avatar to select it
   - After saving, the new avatar appears in the user interface

## Technical Implementation

The following changes were made to implement this feature:

1. Added `profilePicture` field to the user object model
2. Updated the `updateProfile()` method to handle profile picture changes
3. Added visual selector to the profile modal
4. Created styling for avatars in the UI header and profile modal
5. Added backward compatibility for existing users without profile pictures

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements to the avatar feature:

1. More avatar options with different designs (not just color variations)
2. Custom avatar uploads (with appropriate size/content restrictions)
3. Dynamic avatar generation based on username
