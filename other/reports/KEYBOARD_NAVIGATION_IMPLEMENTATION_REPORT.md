- 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (Level A) - Focus can be moved away from any component using the keyboard
- 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (Level A) - Shortcuts using single character keys can be turned off or remapped

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a solid foundation for keyboard accessibility throughout the Trinkaspace application. Users can now navigate and interact with all key features using only a keyboard, significantly improving accessibility and user experience for all users.

The modular approach taken allows for easy extension and enhancement as new features are added to the application. The keyboard navigation system is designed to be maintainable and adaptable to future requirements.
