# Asset Loading System Enhancement

## Changes Made

1. **Added Asset Debugging Tools**
   - Created `assetDebugger.js` with a visual overlay to monitor asset loading
   - Added `asset-debug.css` for styling the debug overlay
   - Added Alt+A keyboard shortcut to toggle asset debugging mode

2. **Enhanced Asset Loading Logging**
   - Added detailed console logging for asset loading attempts
   - Added tracking of successful asset loads with device class detection
   - Fixed image loading process to cleanly handle background images

3. **Added Asset System Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive `ASSET_FALLBACK_SYSTEM_REPORT.md` explaining the current system
   - Provided analysis of the Royal Alpha System and its relationship with the asset fallback chain
   - Clarified the status of L-assets in the system

## How to Use the New Tools

### Asset Debugging Mode

1. Press **Alt+A** to toggle asset debugging mode (reloads page)
2. Visit any page with `?debug=assets` in the URL to activate debugging
3. The overlay will show:
   - Current device class
   - Count of assets loaded by size (XL, L, M, S, XS)
   - List of recently loaded assets with their device class

### Debug Controls

The debug overlay includes two buttons:
- **Inspect Assets**: Checks all dioramas for available asset sizes
- **Clear Log**: Resets the list of tracked assets

### Console Logging

Enhanced console logs include:
- üìê Device class determination
- üñºÔ∏è Initial asset loading attempts
- üîÑ Fallback attempts when an asset isn't found
- ‚úÖ Successful asset loads with device class information

## Asset Fallback System

The asset fallback system still functions as before but with improved logging:

1. Attempts to load assets for the current device class first
2. If that fails, tries progressively smaller sizes
3. The fallback order remains: XL ‚Üí L ‚Üí M ‚Üí S ‚Üí XS

## L-Assets Status

The L-assets are still part of the fallback chain and should be used when:
1. The viewport width is between 1280px and 1919px
2. An XL asset is missing but an L-asset is available

You can use the new debugging tools to verify that L-assets are loading correctly in these scenarios.

## Next Steps

1. Test the system on different screen sizes to verify L-asset loading
2. Monitor the asset loading patterns in real use
3. Consider aligning the fallback logic with the Royal Alpha system in the future if necessary
