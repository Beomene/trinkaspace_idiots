This is a placeholder for the frame_right_1_202029.png file.

Create a PNG image with:
- Height matching your entire diorama height
- Width sufficient for your frame design (50-200px suggested)
- MUST INCLUDE BOTH CORNERS - this covers the upper right corner, right edge, and lower right corner
- Transparent areas where you want the diorama to be visible
- Opaque areas (in #202029 color) for the frame effect

Think of it like placing a twig/branch along the right side of your painting that extends to both corners.
