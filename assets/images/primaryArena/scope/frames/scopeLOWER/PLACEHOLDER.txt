This is a placeholder for frame images.

IMPORTANT: Each frame piece should extend to and include the corners!

For scopeLOWER frames:
- Create a horizontal PNG image that spans the entire bottom edge
- The image should cover the lower left corner, bottom edge, and lower right corner
- The opaque parts (#202029) create the frame
- The transparent parts define the visible area of your diorama
- The transition between them creates your decorative frame effect (jagged, twigs, etc.)

Think of it like placing decorative twigs around a painting on the ground - each frame piece covers a complete side including its corners.
