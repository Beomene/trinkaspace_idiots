This is a placeholder for the frame_lower_1_202029.png file.

Create a PNG image with:
- Width matching your entire diorama width (60vw)
- Height sufficient for your frame design (100-300px suggested)
- MUST INCLUDE BOTH CORNERS - this covers the lower left corner, bottom edge, and lower right corner
- Transparent areas where you want the diorama to be visible
- Opaque areas (in #202029 color) for the frame effect

Think of it like placing a twig/branch across the bottom of your painting that extends to both corners.
