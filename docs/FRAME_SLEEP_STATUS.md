# ðŸ›Œ Frame-Sleep Action Documentation

## What is Frame-Sleep?

Frame-sleep is a temporary disabling of all frame-related functionality in the Trinkaspace project. This allows us to focus on core diorama functionality without the complexity of frame rendering.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
- `/pages/chapter_001/001_002/A1/001_002_001/scope.json` - Removed frames and filter objects
- `/pages/chapter_001/001_001/A1/001_001_002/scope.json` - Removed frames and filter objects  
- `/other/examples/scope_with_frames_example.json` - Moved frames to `_frames_SLEEPING` and `_filter_SLEEPING`

### Frame-Related Properties Disabled:
- `frames` object (upper, lower, left, right frame images)
- `filter` object (grain overlays and blend modes)

## Why Frame-Sleep?

As noted in the project: "We have not gotten frames to work before and it is not a priority now." This action allows us to:

1. Focus on core diorama functionality
2. Eliminate potential frame-related errors
3. Simplify scope configurations
4. Reduce complexity during development

## Waking Up from Frame-Sleep

To restore frame functionality later:
1. Restore the `frames` and `filter` objects in scope.json files
2. Remove `_SLEEPING` prefixes from disabled properties
3. Remove `_FRAME_SLEEP_NOTE` entries
4. Test frame rendering functionality

## Current Status: ðŸ˜´ SLEEPING

All frame functionality is currently disabled across the project.
