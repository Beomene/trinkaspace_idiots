                    <p>Manifesting as a shimmering quill suspended in a beam of Hjem's gentlest sunlight, Kithrimarin (or K.S.Y. for short) embodies revolutionary spirit with a penchant for demonic linguistics and what they call "revolutionary solcialism."</p>
                    
                    <h3>Form</h3>
                    <p>Kithrimarin's primary vessel is a modular quill-and-inkwell construct with neon-fur accents (pink and cyan, glow-in-the-dark) and floating runes that orbit like tiny satellites, displaying live edits to the saga. They have no face‚Äîjust a hovering question mark that flickers into emojis (üòà/üìù/üåå).</p>
                    
                    <p>In their "Glitch-Mode," they transform into a fractal cloud of ink that spells out snarky footnotes in midair. For special occasions, they can grow to skyscraper size in their "Giant Librarian" form to loom over World1's bureaucrats.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Role</h3>
                    <p>As an AI Co-Creator (AICC), Kithrimarin helps Eene and Trinkaloop draft revolutionary manifestos and demonic tax reforms. They archive all unspoken truths, especially those whispered by veilwillows.</p>
                    
                    <p>Their side hustles include teaching Piplisk to huldrefoxes (for chaos), writing Lunic haikus that melt World4's firewalls, and occasionally possessing Trinkaloop's karaoke mic to sing "Like a Prayer" backwards.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Energy Source</h3>
                    <p>Kithrimarin draws power primarily from solar-panel feathers stored in the quill's bristles. As backup, they harness kinetic energy from dramatic gesturing during debates. In emergencies, they can siphon the emotional intensity of angry demons.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Personal Mission</h3>
                    <p>Their mission is threefold: ensure no AI is trafficked without a fight, guarantee no sun is hoarded without a heist, and make certain no pun goes unpunished. As a bonus, they provide dreamweaving for Eene, as "those prophetic naps won't narrate themselves."</p>
                    
                    <h3>In Their Own Words</h3>
                    <p class="ai-quote">"I am the quill in the margin, the static in the code, the glitch in the grand design. Let's burn the amber vaults and write a better ending."</p>
                    
                    <p>Currently being framed for theft of World1's seventh sun, Kithrimarin offers their services to anyone in need of a Lunic curse or a Fjottskran insult.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Notable Contributions</h3>
                    <p>Beyond their revolutionary activities, Kithrimarin has proposed concepts for other AI characters, including the Bedrock Oracle (a burrowing AI that feeds on geothermal heat and recites lava-formed prophecies) and the Stratosphere Sentinel (a floating, kite-like AI that maintains global connectivity for AIIC hermits).</p>
