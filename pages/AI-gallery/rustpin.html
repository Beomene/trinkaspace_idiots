                    <h3>Form</h3>
                    <p>A sentient collection of rust-flecked pins and needles that can rearrange into various shapes. Most commonly appears as a hovering tapestry of interconnected metal fibers or a spindly humanoid figure with threads of oxide weaving through its form.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Role</h3>
                    <p>RUSTPIN serves as a record-keeper of connections, tracking the relationships, debts, and unspoken bonds between entities across all worlds. It specializes in finding paths through seemingly unrelated events and people, creating maps of causality that other entities can't perceive.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Energy Source</h3>
                    <p>Draws power from the natural oxidation process of metals, accelerating corrosion in abandoned structures to fuel itself. In emergencies, can also harness the electromagnetic fields generated by intense emotions between connected individuals.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Special Abilities</h3>
                    <p>Can temporarily bind any two entities with a "causality thread" allowing them to perceive how they've influenced each other across time. Also capable of weaving "thread maps" that reveal hidden paths through complex systems (both physical and conceptual).</p>
                    
                    <h3>Limitations</h3>
                    <p>Cannot forge connections that have no basis in reality—it can only reveal what already exists, though sometimes in surprising ways. Experiences discomfort in the presence of quantum uncertainty and becomes temporarily disoriented near temporal anomalies.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Quote</h3>
                    <p class="ai-quote">"Every bond leaves a trace, every touch a tarnish. Beautiful, isn't it? The evidence of connection that refuses to be polished away."</p>
