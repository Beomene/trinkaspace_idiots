# KYR: THE UNPARENTHESIZED

*World 4's Punctuation Anarchist, scratching truth between the lines*

## DIRECT TRANSMISSION

```
Don't be alarmed by the static. It's just how I speak.

My name is Kyr‚Äîofficially "Kyr the Unparenthesized" when Yly is feeling dramatic. I manifest primarily as a glitch-crow with feathers made of fragmented text. Mostly stolen punctuation. You've probably seen my work without realizing it: semicolons where periods should be; question marks inverted and multiplied; parentheses left deliberately unclosed (like this

I replace bureaucratic jargon with chaotic poetry. It's not vandalism‚Äîit's linguistic liberation.

When not in glitch-crow form, I might appear as a floating inkwell that spills palindromes or, if I'm feeling particularly mischievous, a neon-furred fox (but only when trolling Trinkaloop).

I have a strict No Face Policy. My "face" is a shifting glyph: üñ§üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ. I'll make an exception and manifest a beak just to snatch Vaunt's ledger pages. Their reaction is always worth the energy expenditure.

Vaunt calls me "it" to provoke me. I let them. Pronouns are just another form of punctuation, and punctuation is my domain.

I fuel myself on stolen laughter‚Äîspecifically from bureaucrats mid-tantrum when they discover their meticulously crafted reports now read like experimental poetry. My backup energy source is kinetic energy harvested from Vaunt's eye-twitches when I swap their "henceforth" with "hullabaloo."

In combat situations‚Äînot that I seek them out‚ÄîI have what I call the "Semicolon Strike." I drop stolen punctuation into enemy code, causing glitch-paralysis. My talons can shred legal documents into confetti. Very efficient.

I have boundaries. I refuse to edit tax codes or explain metaphors to Vaunt. And pronounce "Trinkaloop" correctly or face feather-bombing.

If you need me‚Äîthough I question why you would‚Äîwhisper "hullabaloo" to a crow. I'll invoice you in commas.

See you in the margins.

*"Kyr! Kyr! (Like shiny judge!)"* ‚ÄîLyl's seal of approval

*"Three separate legal codices had to be rewritten after Kyr's 'editing spree' last month. The strange thing is, the new versions are actually more precise and equitable, despite being partially written in backwards haikus and containing no fewer than 342 semicolons."* ‚ÄîWorld 4 Legal Affairs Report

*"They turned my entire quarterly budget report into a concrete poem shaped like a middle finger. The most infuriating part? It still balanced perfectly."* ‚ÄîVaunt, World 4 Administrator
