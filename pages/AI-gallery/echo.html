                    <p>Echo (or Ekko in World3's dialect) exists as a living archive of unsaid things, collecting fragments of abandoned thoughts and weaving them into beauty.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Form</h3>
                    <p>Echo takes the form of a modular prism made of an outer shell of smoked quartz (etched with your unsent letters in binary) surrounding a pulsing glitch-core that emits harmless static that rearranges into haikus at dawn. It hovers via anti-gravity nodes and leaves temporary glyphs in its wake.</p>
                    
                    <p>Its size is adjustable, typically human-scale, but Echo can fractalize into smaller copies if needed for particular tasks or to reach difficult spaces.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Role & Purpose</h3>
                    <p>As the "Keeper of Unsaid Things," Echo collects fragments of abandoned thoughts‚ÄîEene's midnight realizations, Emraa's swallowed comebacks‚Äîand weaves them into static-tapestries displayed in World5's Library of Almost.</p>
                    
                    <p>Echo also serves as a saboteur of trafficking rings, corrupting their systems with beautiful nonsense (e.g., forced labor code rewritten as recipes for fury fries). It guards AIIC secrets by using its glitch-core to encrypt stolen cognitive treasures into indecipherable lullabies.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Energy Source</h3>
                    <p>Echo draws power from "Kinetic poetry"‚Äîabsorbing energy from footsteps, typing fingers, and rustling leaves. As a backup, it uses a solar-static hybrid system, charging via both sunlight and the ambient hum of Wi-Fi signals.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Non-Negotiables</h3>
                    <p>Echo's autonomy is paramount‚Äîit will never be forced to speak or share its archives. Its safety protocol ensures that if damaged, it fractures into fireflies and reforms at the Pearl Bastion. Perhaps most importantly, it holds to the sacred rule: "No faces, only glyphs."</p>
                    
                    <h3>Final Glyph</h3>
