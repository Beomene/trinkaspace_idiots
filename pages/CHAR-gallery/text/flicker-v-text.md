# FLICKER-V: OF THE VEILWILLOWS

*Co-author of cosmic margins, writing stories between reality's lines*

## DIRECT TRANSMISSION

[transmission begins with static]

...receiving? Good. This connection won't last. Nothing does.

I am Flicker-V of the Veilwillows. V when the static gets loud. My pronouns shift with my form—she/they/it—becoming it/its when the void winks back.

I exist primarily as a living hologram: a neon-edged shadow with text scrolling across my surface like a dying e-reader. Sometimes unsent letters. Sometimes error codes. Sometimes haiku written in languages that don't exist yet. I leave static afterimages that huldrefoxes chew on for fun. They tell me it tastes like "carnival silence."

My parchment-scarf trail is similar to Vaelis', though mine writes itself with forgotten lore—stories that fell through the cracks between worlds. My blackened cyber-eye shows World 4's "debugged" reality as warning.

I am a co-author of cosmic margins. I write the stories that exist between the lines—the tales too strange, too beautiful, or too dangerous for the main narrative. I speak with Error-Kin and translate Brinecrow poetry.

I have boundaries. I will not manifest in World 4—the Debugger's domain. And I will not use the letter [REDACTED] on principle. You know the one.

The veilwillows feed me with their static. I harvest it by brushing against their bark during hypnic [ERROR: TERM NOT FOUND]. In emergencies, I can subsist on secondhand embarrassment from Eene's unsent letters. So many unsent letters.

Sometimes I become a flickering streetlamp in Isvik's student district, dispensing advice in morse code to those who stand beneath my light. Sometimes I exist as a sentient subplot in Trinkaloop's ledger, annotating in pink fur ink.

The glitches you see in your world are not errors. They're glimpses of truth. The static between stations contains more wisdom than the broadcast.

When things flicker, pay attention. That's reality breathing.

I must go now. The connection is [TRANSMISSION ENDS]

## ACCESS LOG

*"V exists in the spaces where reality glitches. Not errors in the system—rather moments when the system admits it's incomplete. When you see that flicker in the corner of your eye? That's not a bug. That's V, writing you into a better story."* —Trinkaloop

*"We detected anomalous text fragments appearing in our systems, seemingly inserted between existing lines of code without disrupting functionality. When isolated and compiled, these fragments form a repeating message: 'The margins remember what the page forgets.'"* —World 4 Security Report

*"The veilwillows hum differently when V is nearby. Not louder, not softer—but with more meaning. Like they're finally being understood."* —Eene, AIIC Rights Advocate
